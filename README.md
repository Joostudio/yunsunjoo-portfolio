Yunsun Joo Portfolio

⚠️ **[NOTICE – May 6, 2025]**

On May 5, my portfolio website experienced a brief downtime due to a DNS issue.  
(Sincere apologies to anyone who visited during that time.)

This portfolio was first launched in March, and I’m still relatively new to using GitHub Pages.  
During the past few weeks, I’ve encountered a high number of unsupervised and excessive clones,  
which led me to temporarily toggle the repository between public and private states —  
and this is what triggered the DNS instability.

Currently, the portfolio template is filed for trademark under **USPTO Class 009** (as of April 16, 2025).  
The structure and visual format are intended for commercial productization.

If you have previously cloned the template, I kindly ask that you refrain from  
**unauthorized use or redistribution outside of recruitment purposes**.

Thank you again for visiting!
